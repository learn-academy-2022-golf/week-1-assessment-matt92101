# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:
Conditional statements are commands for handiling decisions within a programming language. All conditional statements must have an "If" statement. The logic behind conditional statments say - if "this" is true, do this action, If not do this other action instead.

Researched answer:
Conditional statements control behavior in a programming language and determine whether or not a piece of code can be executed.There ares several different types of conditionals in JavaScript. IF statements dertermine if a condition is true. It is used to specify execution of a particular action for in a piece of code ELSE IF statements determine if the same condition is false. If so, the code will specifiy different action to perform instead. ELSE statement specifify a  if the first condition is false.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a document control system designed to track revisions of code.

Researched answer: Git is a source code managment (SCM) system that trackes changes to source code. Perhaps the most vital fuctionality of Git is its branching capability. Git allows uses to have multiple local branches that are separate from each other.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Equality operators, Relational operators, logical operators

Researched answer:
Comparison operators are used in logical statments to determine equality or differnce between a value or variable. Some comparison operators include:
loose equality ==
strict equlity ===
! not equal
> greater than
less than
Logical operators are used to determine logic between values or variables. Some logical operators include: 
&& And
|| Or
! Not

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:

An index is a placement or position of a character starting with 0. There can be several items in an array. These items are called elements and within each element is a value. The value is the content of each element. Using an index, we can give a numerical position to an element.

Researched answer:

Javascript variables are containers for data values. Javascript arrays are zero indexed. An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:

Arrays are pieces of information grouped together into a single entity. A string is a sequence of characters. The main objective of an array is to group multiple pieces of data into a single entity which we can identify using one "name". A string is a group of individaul characters set inside quotation mark.

Researched answer:

The major difference between an array and a string is that an Array is a data that holds a collection of elements having the same data types. A String is a collection of characters. An array can hold any data type whereas a string is limited to only character data types.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
Pair programming is a cooperative approach to writing code is a programming environemnt. Generally there are two roles in pair programming - the driver and navigator. The driver has control of the keyboard and is activiely engaging with the source code editor. The navigator provides input and instructions for the driver to input in the source code editor.

Researched answer:

There are some common expectations in pair programming. First, both programmers must be actively engaging with the task through a constant stream of communication. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the complex details of assigned coding tasks, ultimately reducing the risks of errors.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: 

Higher order functions are functions that takes another function as an argument or returns a function
(Sohamderoy, 2022)

2. Jest:

Jest is a JavaScript test runner. It is a JavaScript library for creating, running, and structuring tests.
(Jest Tutorial for Beginners, 2019)

3. Objects:

An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name and a value. For example, a book could be considered an object. However a book has many different properties such as color, size, material, etc.
Working with Objects - JavaScript | MDN, n.d.)

4. Method:

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Working with Objects - JavaScript | MDN, n.d.)

5. Classes:
Classes are a template for creating Javascript objects. For example, when you have a class, you can create objects under that class. For example we can have use "Car Class" to create two related objects associated with "Car Class"
Working with classes - JavaScript | MDN, n.d.)
